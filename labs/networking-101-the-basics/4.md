## Step 4: What are Switches, Routers and Interfaces? How are They Configured?

### Switches, Router and Interfaces  

In Step 3 we talked a little about what Hubs, Switches and Routers do.  Since Switches and Routers are most commonly used in the network, let's delve more into them, learn what they do and how they use Interfaces.

Let's start by defining the characteristics and behavior of a switch versus that of a router.

*Various Cisco Switches*

The Switch and its Behavior
1. Is a [Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer) device, so most interfaces do not have IPv4 addresses. Layers will be covered in another learning lab.
2. Via its hardware portals which are RJ45 ports that can be connected by Ethernet cables, it connects to a single router or other switches along with host devices such as computers, printers, and other network host devices.
3. Via ARP it determines to which device to send data and then transmits data to and from that device.
4. Prevents network data collisions via microsegmentation to improve traffic flow.
5. Has a configurable software interface for each of its RJ45 ports.
6. Allows for configuration of its interfaces such as the creation of [Virtual Lans (VLANs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN) (not covered in this lesson).

Here's a sample configuration of a switch's interfaces.  Notice that no IP addresses are present.

Now let's discuss the characteristics and behavior of a router

*Various Cisco Routers*

The Router and its Behavior
1. Is a [Layer 3 (Network Layer)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer) device, so most interfaces **do** have IPv4 addresses. Layers will be covered in another lab.
2. Connects to other routers or switches via its hardware portals which are RJ45 ports that can be connected by Ethernet cables.
3. Via its routing table it determines which switch or router to send the data.  It routes data to the proper network device.
4. Has a configurable software interface for each of its RJ45 ports.
5. Allows for configuration of its interfaces and many other features such routing tables, network address translation and much more.  Configuration details are not covered in this learning lab.

Here's a sample configuration of a router's interfaces.  Notice that each interface has an IP address.

Now that you have a high level overview of what routers and switches do, you should now have a general idea of why they have interfaces. But let's cover interfaces here.

Interfaces and Their Behavior
1. Each RJ45 portal has at least one interface to be configured.
2. A Network Engineer configures the interface via the Command Line Interface (CLI) where he/she types in commands to configure and activate/deactivate an interface.  This configuration is completed for interfaces used for all routers and switches as well as other devices to which they connect.
3. The configuration commands can be quite extensive such as creating Virtual Interfaces, Trunk Ports, Virtual LANS, attaching policies and functionality to various interfaces and much more.


We've described Switches, Routers and Interfaces so let's tie this new information back to the network we discussed back in Step 1.

*Simple Local Area Network (LAN)*

Let's revisit the network connections between the student and instructor computers.
1. All hardware connections between all network devices are by Ethernet cables.
2. From the diagram above starting from the bottom right to left, the student network host computers connect to the RJ45 portals on the switch. Each of the portals has an interface not shown here.
3. A portal on the switch connects to the router's (RTR2) RJ45 portal defined by the FastEthernet1/0 interface.
4. The router (RTR2) connects to another router (RTR1) which in this case is via a portal defined by a Serial0/0 interface.  
5. The router (RTR2) also connects to a switch via its portal which is defined by a FastEthernet0/0 interface.  
6. And finally, the switch connects to the Instructor network host computers via its RJ45 portals. Each of these portals has an interface not shown.  
7. Bear in mind that each of the network host devices discussed also have interfaces with defined IP addresses as well.

### The Network Engineer
It's the responsibility of the Network Engineer to configure the interfaces and other features of all of these hardware devices.  There are ways to have some of this information added dynamically, but that requires configuration as well which the Network Engineer must do.  The Network Engineer also does all of the physical wiring which as you know means connecting all of the devices via Ethernet cables.

### Stuff to Think About
1. By what hardware devices do the student computers communicate with the administration computers?

2. If a student computer wanted to send information to an administration computer what information must that computer have to start?  What are the possible processes used to find the administration computer?

3. What could happen if the Network Engineer makes a mistake when configuring devices such as assigning the wrong IP address to a device or connecting a device to the wrong portal?

**Next Step:**  What does REST and SDN have to do with any of this stuff?
