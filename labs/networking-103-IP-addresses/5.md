# Step 5: Configuring subnets

## Simple subnet example
For this example, look at a class C IP address of `207.21.54.0 /24`. The network's IP address is `207.21.54.0` and the default class C subnet mask `255.255.255.0` has been applied. The last octet of the subnet mask has all 8 bits available for host IP addresses, which means that on the network `207.21.54.0 /24`, there can be up to 2<sup>8</sup> (256) available subnet addresses.

Two IP addresses are in use by default:
* `207.21.54.0` is the network address
* `207.21.54.255` is the broadcast address

Therefore, there are 254 (256 - 2) host IP addresses available, and the range of addresses available for hosts would be `207.21.54.1` to `207.21.54.254`

## Real-world subnet example

Subnets in practical use cases are not as simple. For example, you may have a class C network that is used by 8 departments of 20 people each. If you want to assign a subnet to each department, you need 8 subnets, and those subnets require a minimum of 20 IP addresses for hosts.

The network IP address is `192.168.2.7`. In the Class C default mask, the last octet has 8 bits available. Of those 8 bits, you will need 3 to create 8 subnets (2<sup>3</sup> = 8). This leaves the remaining 5 bits for the hosts (2<sup>5</sup = 32). Therefore, the CIDR notation-formatted IP address for the network will be `192.168.2.7 /27`.

This can be more easily visualized when showing the subnet mask in binary format.

* Default Class C subnet mask: `11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000`
* Modified subnet mask for this example: `11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000`

All Class C subnet masks use the first 24 bits for the network. Because you need to create 8 subnets, you designate 3 bits in the last octet for subnet use. The remaining 5 bits are for the hosts, and provide each subnet with 32 IP addresses.

The following table lists the network address, broadcast address, and available host address range for each subnet.

| **Subnet** | **Network address** | **Broadcast address** | **Available host address range** |
|------------|---------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Subnet 1   | 192.168.2.0         | 192.168.2.31          | 192.168.2.1 to 192.168.2.30      |
| Subnet 2   | 192.168.2.32        | 192.168.2.63          | 192.168.2.33 to 192.168.2.62     |
| Subnet 3   | 192.168.2.64        | 192.168.2.95          | 192.168.2.65 to 192.168.2.94     |
| Subnet 4   | 192.168.2.96        | 192.168.2.127         | 192.168.2.97 to 192.168.2.126    |
| Subnet 5   | 192.168.2.128       | 192.168.2.159         | 192.168.2.129 to 192.168.2.158   |
| Subnet 6   | 192.168.2.160       | 192.168.2.191         | 192.168.2.161 to 192.168.2.190   |
| Subnet 7   | 192.168.2.192       | 192.168.2.223         | 192.168.2.193 to 192.168.2.222   |
| Subnet 8   | 192.168.2.224       | 192.168.2.255         | 192.168.2.225 to 192.168.2.254   |

## CIDR Notation Revisited

With these examples in mind, review the following CIDR notation table for class C.

Notice the allocation for subnets and hosts specified for each row. You should now understand how designating bits to create subnets reduces the number of hosts available for each subnet. The number of hosts available per subnet takes into account that network and broadcast addresses each require an IP address.

| **Subnet mask** | **Binary**                           | **CIDR** | **Subnets** | **Hosts per subnet** |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|----------|-------------|----------------------|

### Answers
<ol>
<li>5 bits are allocated for subnets and 3 for hosts.
<li>subnets = 2^5=32 and hosts are 2^3=8. So there are 32 subnets each containing 8 host IP addresses.
<li>No because /31 allocates 1 bit for hosts which is only 2^1=2 hosts and both IPs would be used for the network and broadcast addresses. /32 allocates 0 bits for hosts so it's useless.
<li>202.8.21.12 /28
<li>Subnet 3: `NW=192.168.2.64, BC=192.168.2.95, LH=192.168.2.94. Subnet 4: NW=192.168.2.96, BC=192.168.2.127, LH=192.168.2.126. Subnet 5: NW=192.168.2.128, BC=192.168.2.159, LH=192.168.2.158.
