# Power On Auto Provisioning (POAP) on Nexus Switches Part 1 - Setting up POAP Infrastructure

POAP automates the process of device instantiation for Nexus switches. This includes system OS installation and initial configuration, upon first boot of Nexus switches when taking them out of the box and powering them up for the first time. In this lab, you will learn to set up a complete POAP infrastructure and use it to provision Nexus switches. For more details about POAP, please refer to the [POAP documentation.]( https://developer.cisco.com/site/nx-os/docs/automation/poap/index.gsp )

The lab is divided into two parts. In the first part (this lab), we will set up the server side components needed for the POAP process to work successfully on the Nexus switches. In the second part, we will initiate the POAP process on the devices and observe the automatic provisioning process.

## Objectives

 - Understand how the POAP process works
 - Understand the requirements for POAP
 - Set up external services required for POAP:
   - DHCP Server
   - TFTP Server
   - Configuration Server
 - Understand how the POAP Python script works that executes on the switch
 - Learn how to walk-through and execute POAP on Nexus switches 

## Prerequisites

The lab makes the following assumptions:
 - The user has an understanding of DHCP, HTTP, and TFTP
 - The user has working knowledge of Python
 - The user has working knowledge of Ansible 
 - The user has knowledge of nano or other Linux based text editors
