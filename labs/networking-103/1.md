# Networking 103 IPv4 Addresses and Subnetting #

In this Learning Lab, you learn a lot about IPv4 addresses, binary numbers and subnetting.


## Objective ##

Completion Time: 45 minutes

* Learn about IPv4 addresses.
* Understand how to use binary numbers.
* Learning about subnets, hosts and how to do subnetting.

* This lesson focuses on wired networks. Wireless networks have other network components not covered here.

## Prerequisites

* You have some general knowledge about networks and have completed the labs: Networking 101 and 102.
* Familiarity with IPv4 protocol; otherwise known as Internet Protocol version 4.

## Additional Information

* Cisco provides online detailed tutorials on Networking at <a href="https://learningnetworkstore.cisco.com/">the Cisco Learning Network Store</a> and the <a href="https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/welcome"> the Cisco Learning Network</a>.

## Step 1. IPv4 Addresses

### Why Should I care about IP Addresses?
Every device on a network has a unique IP address. This IP address, along with a MAC address, is used to access and communicate with all network devices. Without IP addresses there would be no Internet!


### What are IPv4 Addresses?
IPv4 stands for Internet Protocol version 4 and is a core protocol used for Internet communication. IPv4 was introduced in 1983. Despite the introduction of IPv6, IPv4 continues to route most of the Internet traffic today. For more information, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4">IPv4</a>.

An IPv4 address is composed of four *octets*. Each decimal value is separated by a dot, so it's sometimes known as *dotted decimal notation*. Each octet is made up of eight *bits*, and each bit can be a value of 1 or 0.

*IPv4 Address*

Taking a closer look at the IP address shown in the table, each value is represented by eight bits. Each bit is represented by a 1 or 0. Don't worry about the bits right now, but note that there are always eight of them in each octet, and that there are always four octets in an IPv4 address.

*IPv4 Address*

Here is another IPv4 address. The format is the same. Another important tidbit is that 8 bits make up what is called a *byte*, which is what you call an octet. Because an IP address will always have 4 octets (aka bytes), an IP address is always 4 bytes long or 32 bits ( 8 bits times 4 = 32 bits).
