# Step 2: Understand device compatibility with networking

A common use case for a small network may be as follows: a home office with four computers, each physically attached to a switch or a hub. You purchase an inexpensive printer, intending to connect it to the network so that it will be available for all computers, but the printer is not network-compatible.

The printer cannot connect to the network because it does not have a Network Interface Card (NIC) card. Each of your computers has a NIC card and so should your printer.

*Network Interface Card (NIC)*

NIC cards vary in size and appearance, and may look different from what is shown here. This network card has a Registered Jack 45 port (RJ-45) that you can connect to a wired network with an Ethernet cable. There are many types of Ethernet cables, but they all have male connectors that can plug into an RJ-45 port.

Each NIC card has a unique Media Access Control (MAC) address that identifies the physical device, also known as a physical address. The MAC address is printed on the card and usually cannot be changed. A MAC address is six bytes long, in hexadecimal format. The first three bytes are the vendor ID, and the last three bytes are the NIC ID.

A NIC card also has a Internet Protocol Address (IPv4) address. You can configure a static address, or the network card can get a dynamically-assigned address from a DHCP service on the network. An IP address consists of four values, called octets, that range from 0 to 255 and are separated from each other by dots. An IP address must be unique on the network.

In the use case described at the beginning, you will need to replace the printer with one that has a NIC card. You connect the new printer's RJ-45 port to the network hub with an Ethernet cable. After completing any additional configuration tasks required by your hardware, your computers will be able to print to the networked printer.
