## Step 4: What are Switches, Routers, and Interfaces? How are They Configured?

### Switches, Routers, and Interfaces  

In Step 3, you talked about hubs, switches, and routers. Because switches and routers are commonly used, learn more about what they do and how they use interfaces.

Now, start by defining the characteristics and behavior of a switch compared to those of a router.

*Various Cisco Switches*

A switch:
* Is a [Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer) device, so most interfaces do not have IPv4 addresses. Layers will be covered in another learning lab.
* Uses its RJ45 ports to connect to other devices such as a router, switches, and other network hosts (e.g., computers and printers).
* Uses ARP to determine with which device it should exchange data.
* Uses microsegmentation to prevents network data collisions and improve traffic flow.
* Has a configurable software interface for each of its RJ45 ports.
* Supports configuration of its interfaces, for example, to create [Virtual LANs (VLANs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN) (not covered in this lesson).

Here is a sample configuration of a switch's interfaces. Notice that no IP addresses are present.

Now examine the characteristics and behavior of a router.

*Various Cisco Routers*

A router:
* Is a [Layer 3 (Network Layer)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer) device, so most interfaces **do** have IPv4 addresses. Layers will be covered in another lab.
* Connects to other routers or switches through its hardware portals, which are RJ45 ports that can be connected by Ethernet cables.
* Uses a routing table to determines which switch or router should receive data. It routes data to the proper network device.
* Has a configurable software interface for each of its RJ45 ports.
* Supports configuration of its interfaces and other features such as routing tables, network address translation, and more. Configuration details are not covered in this learning lab.

Here is a sample configuration of a router's interfaces. Notice that each interface has an IP address.

*Sample Router Configuration*


The preceding overview of routers and switches provided some information about interfaces. Now, provide some more information here.

For interfaces:
* Each RJ45 portal has at least one interface that can be configured.
* A network engineer can configure and activate/deactivate an interface using a terminal (or command line interface) to enter commands. This configuration is completed for all of the interfaces that connect to other devices.
* The configuration commands can be extensive and support creating virtual interfaces, trunk ports, virtual LANs, attaching policies and functionality to various interfaces, and more.


You have described switches, routers, and interfaces. Now, tie this new information back to the network you saw in Step 1.

*Simple Local Area Network (LAN)*

Now, revisit the network connections between the student and instructor computers.
1. All of the connections between network devices use Ethernet cables.
2. From the diagram shown, starting from the bottom, right to left, the student network host computers connect to the RJ45 portals on the switch. Each of the portals has an interface not shown here.
3. A portal on the switch connects to the router's (RTR2) RJ45 portal, defined by the FastEthernet1/0 interface.
4. The router (RTR2) connects to another router (RTR1), which, in this case, is through a portal defined by a Serial0/0 interface.
5. The router (RTR2) also connects to a switch through its portal, which is defined by a FastEthernet0/0 interface.
6. The switch connects to the Instructor network host computers through its RJ45 portals. Each of these portals has an interface not shown.
7. Bear in mind that each of the network host devices has interfaces with defined IP addresses as well.

### The Network Engineer
Network engineers are responsible for configuring the interfaces and other features of these hardware devices. There are ways to add some of this information dynamically, but that also requires a network engineer to perform configuration tasks. Network engineers also perform all of the physical wiring, connecting devices using Ethernet cable.

### Things to Consider
* Through which hardware devices do the student computers communicate with the administration computers?
* If a student computer wants to send information to an administration computer, what information does it need to start? What are the possible processes used to find the administration computer?
* What could happen if a network engineer misconfigures a device, such as assigning the wrong IP address to it, or connecting a it to the wrong portal?

**Next Step:**  How do REST and SDN relate to this information?
