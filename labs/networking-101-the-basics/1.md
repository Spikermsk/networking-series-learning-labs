# Step 1. What is a Network?

A network consists of host devices such as computers, mobile devices, and printers that are connected by networking devices such as switches and routers. The network enables the devices to communicate with one another and share data.

In this diagram, data from the student computer to the instructor computer travels through the switch to the router (FastEthernet Interface 1/0), then to the next switch (FastEthernet Interface 0/0), and finally to the instructor computer.

As you proceed through this lab, you will learn the answers to the following questions:
* Why do some devices work on networks and others do not?
* How do devices find each other?
* What are switches, routers, and interfaces and how are they configured?
* How do REST and SDN relate to this information?

**Next:** Understand device compatibility with networking
