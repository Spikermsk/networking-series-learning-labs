# Step 5: Understand SDN and REST in the context of networking

This step provides an overview of Software-Defined Networks (SDN) and Representational State Transfer (REST), and how these technologies relate to networking.

## Software-Defined Networks (SDN)

Network engineers configure network devices using a command line interface. This work can be time-consuming and error-prone.

A [Sofware Defined Network (SDN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking) uses networking software to configure the network. SDN adds new features and protocols to network devices. These features and protocols enable third-party applications to dynamically configure the devices and define how the devices process data.

On a network device, data enters and leaves through the *data plane*. The decisions of what to do with the data are made on the *control plane*. Before SDN, these two planes essentially functioned as one. SDN separated the planes to enable completion of network configuration and decisions through a remote control plane.

## Representational State Transfer (REST)

To make the SDN features on these devices accessible over the network, they are exposed through an Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Network engineers use software that connects to these APIs to configure switches and routers dynamically.

Many newer APIs are based the [Representational State Transfer (REST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) protocol, which is designed to simplify function calls. If you are not familiar with REST, the [Coding 101 REST Basics Learning Lab](/lab/getting-started-rest-apis) is a good introduction.

With the implementation of SDN, Cisco and several other companies have created new technologies, such as SDN controllers with APIs that developers can use to dynamically configure and change the network. A few of these controllers are [Cisco DNA](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/index.html) and [OpenDaylight](https://developer.cisco.com/site/opendaylight/). You can learn more about these controllers via the DevNet Learning Labs.

## Questions to Consider

* What network configuration would you want to automate using SDN?
* What features of REST make it simple to use?
