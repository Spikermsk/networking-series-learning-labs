# Step 3: IP classes and private IPs

## IP address classes

There are five classes of IP addresses. Classes A, B, and C are available for public use, while Class D is used specifically for multicast addresses. Class E is reserved for research and development and is not available for public use.

| **Address class** | **Bit pattern of first byte** | First byte decimal range | Host assignment range in dotted decimal |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| A                 | 0xxxxxxx                      | 1 to 127                 | 1.0.0.1 to 127.255.255.254              |
| B                 | 10xxxxxx                      | 128 to 191               | 128.0.0.1 to 191.255.255.254            |
| C                 | 110xxxxx                      | 192 to 223               | 192.0.0.1 to 223.255.255.254            |
| D                 | 1110xxxx                      | 224 to 239               | 224.0.0.1 to 239.255.255.254            |
| E                 | 11110xxx                      | 240 to 255               | 240.0.0.1 to 255.255.255.255            |

## Private IP addresses

Classes A, B, and C each have a range of IP addresses reserved for internal use, which means that they cannot be used on the public Internet. This internal use designation is known as *Private IP addresses*. It turns out that private IP addresses are quite useful because they are used in nearly all businesses and homes. There are several reasons for using them.

| **Address class** | **Private network ID** | Network address range          |
|-------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| A                 | 10.0.0.0               | 1.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255      |
| B                 | 172.16.0.0             | 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255   |
| C                 | 192.168.0.0            | 192.169.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 |

1. Public IP addresses are not free; each one is paid for by a user or company. Using private IP addresses saves money.
2. There is a finite number of public IPv4 addresses, and they are running out. There are 4,294,967,296 IPv4 addresses in total, and of those, there are only 3,706,452,992 public addresses. That may sound like a lot, but remember that there are over 7 billion people on the planet. In industrialized countries, each person typically uses several network devices, each with its own IP address.
3. Private IP addresses offer a level of security. If your laptop has a private IP address, it's harder to trace its location because that IP address is not visible from the Internet. There are also ways of obfuscating your IP to reduce the chance of being found.

## Translating private IP addresses to public
Your laptop most likely has a private IP address, but it's able to access the Internet via [Network Address Translation (NAT)](http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Computer_Science/NAT_and_PAT.asp) and [Port Address Translation (PAT)](http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Computer_Science/NAT_and_PAT.asp). Outgoing data from your device is sent through a router, which maps your device's private IP address to a public IP address. When the data returns to that router, it looks up your device's private IP address and routes it to its destination.
