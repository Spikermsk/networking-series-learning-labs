## Step 2: Network Wiring and Cables

### How are network devices wired?
Shortly you'll examine some of the various classifications of network cables, their capacity and more. However, first start with what's inside the cables...wires. These wires are typically twisted together in pairs to reduce interference. Twisted-pair wiring that does not have a shield is called *unshielded*. Twisted-pair wiring that has a shield covering each twisted pair or all of the wires to further reduce the possibility of interference is aptly named *shielded*.

### What are the different network cables categories?

Network devices are connected by network cables. However, the throughput, allowed distance, and other characteristics of these cables vary, depending on the specific rating of the cable.

*Ethernet Cable Categories*

The table shown lists the most commonly used network cable categories. It should be clear that the network engineer cannot run cables to some unlimited length. Due to resistance in the wires, when the maximum length is reached the signal degrades, and data is lost. Therefore, hardware devices called repeaters are sometimes needed to connect cables to repeat/strengthen the signal that is being sent.

### What are straight and crossover network cables?
To determine if you have a straight or crossover network cable, you can typically read the description written on the cable. However, a faster and more accurate way would be to take both ends of the cable in your hands and put the RJ45 male ends side-by-side. If the colored wires are in the same order on both RJ45's, then you have a straight cable. If the colored wires are in a different order, you have a crossover cable.

*Crossover Ethernet Cable*

### Using straight and crossover cables to connect these devices
While many network devices today enable the network engineer to connect them using a straight or crossover cable, it's still important for the engineer to use the right cable to prevent possible issues. Whether the network engineer should use a straight or crossover cable to connect network devices depends upon the type of device being connected. For example, an engineer would use a crossover cable to connect a switch to another switch, and a straight cable to connect a switch to a router.

*Devices and Cables*

From the table shown one might see that there are certain patterns.
  * Use a crossover cable to connect any device that connects to the same device type. For example, use a crossover cable to connect a router to another router, a switch to another switch or a computer to another computer. There are two exceptions to this rule: Use a crossover cable to connect a hub to a switch and connect a router to a computer, which is uncommon.
  * Use a straight cable when connecting different devices. For example, when connecting a switch to a router, a switch to a computer, a hub to a router or a hub to a computer, use a straight cable.


  ### Something to Consider
  1. If you were building your network and needed to connect a set of computers to a switch which then connected to a router, what types and categories of network cables would you use to connect each device?
