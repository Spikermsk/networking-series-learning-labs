## Step 3: IP Classes and Private IPs

### IP Classes and Private IPs

Before we start making heavy use of binary numbers lets learn a few more things about IP addresses. As you might have guessed they have several classes.  There are five of them, and each class has its own range of IP addresses.  Classes A, B and C are available for public use while Class D is used specifically for multicast addresses.  Class E is reserved for research and development, so is not available for public use.

*IP Classes*

Another thing to know about classes A, B and C is that they each have a range of IP addresses that are for internal use only which means that they cannot be used in the public Internet.  This internal use designation is known as *Private IP addresses*.  It turns out that private IP addresses are quite useful because they are used in nearly all businesses and homes.  There are several reasons for using them.

### Why are Private IP Addresses Needed?
1. Public IP addresses are not free.  You/your company pays for each one, so using a private IP address saves money.
2. Public IPv4 addresses are running out!  There are 4,294,967,296 IPv4 addresses in total and of those there are only 3,706,452,992 public addresses.  That number may sound like a lot, but remember that there are over 7 billion people on the planet! And in industrialized countries each person typically has several network devices, and each device has an IP address.
3. Private IP addresses offer a level of security.  If your laptop has a private IP address it's harder to trace the location of it since that IP does not get out to the Internet, and is therefore unknown. In addition, there are ways of obfuscating your IP to reduce the chance of being found.

### Private to Public IPs
Your laptop most likely has a private IP address, but it's able to access the Internet where only public IP addresses are allowed.  How can that be? Well there are network translation techniques used called Network Address Translation <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Computer_Science/NAT_and_PAT.asp">(NAT)</a> or Port Address Translation <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Computer_Science/NAT_and_PAT.asp">(PAT)</a> so that when your data is about to leave the private confines of your home or work that the router maps your laptop's private IP to an existing public IP address.  When the data returns to that router, your private IP address is found and used internally to send the data back to your laptop.
