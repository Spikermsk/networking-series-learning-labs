## Step 5: How do REST and SDN relate to this information?

### Software-Defined Networks (SDN) and Representational State Transfer (REST)

Recall that network engineers configure network devices using a terminal (or command line interface). This work is quite time-consuming and error-prone.

What if engineers could use software to define or modify networks? This is called a [Sofware Defined Network (SDN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking).

With the introduction of SDN, new features and protocols were introduced to network devices such as switches and routers. These features and protocols enabled third-party applications to dynamically configure the devices and define how to process data.

How does SDN work? On a network device, data enters and leaves through the *data plane*. The decisions of what to do with the data are made by what is called a *control plane*. Before SDN, these two planes were tied together essentially as one. SDN separated these into two separate planes so that network configuration and decisions could be completed through a remote control plane.

To make the SDN features on these devices accessible over the network, they are exposed through an Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Network engineers use software that connects to these APIs to configure switches and routers dynamically.

Many newer APIs are based the [Representational State Transfer (REST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) protocol, which is designed to simplify function calls. If you are not familiar with REST. Please see the [Coding 101 Rest Basics Learning Lab](/lab/coding-101-rest-basics-ga/step/1).

With the implementation of SDN, Cisco and several other companies have created new technologies, such as SDN controllers with APIs that developers can use to dynamically configure and change the network. A few of these controllers are [APIC-EM](https://developer.cisco.com/site/apic-em/) and [OpenDaylight](https://developer.cisco.com/site/opendaylight/). To learn more about SDN controllers and their functionality, visit the DevNet Learning Labs specific to each one.

### Things to Consider
* What network configuration would you want to automate using SDN?
* What features of REST make it simple to use?

Congratulations!  You have completed Networking-101 Basics!
