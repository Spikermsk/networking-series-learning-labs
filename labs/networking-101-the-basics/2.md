## Step 2: What do Some Devices Work on Networks and Others Don't?

### What do Devices Need to Run on a Network?
Let's assume in your home office that you have four computers that connect to a switch or a hub, and you want each computer to be able to print data. You go shopping for a printer and buy the cheapest one you can find to use in your home office.  However, after bringing the printer home you can't figure out how to connect your printer to your network.

The issue is that the printer you bought does not run on the network.  For any device to run on a network it needs to have a Network Interface Card (NIC) card. Each of your computers have a NIC card and so should your printer.

*Network Interface Card (NIC)*

The NIC card will vary in size. Some will be much smaller and look different than what you see here.

This card contains several features.  We'll discuss the features relevant to our discussion below.
* For wired networks a Registered Jack (RJ) 45 port in which you can plug in an Ethernet cable for wired access.  There are many different types of Ethernet cables, but they all have male connectors that can plug into an RJ-45 port.

*Ethernet Cable*

* A unique ID identifying the device.  This unique ID is called a Media Access Control (MAC) address. The MAC address is imprinted on the card and usually cannot be changed. The MAC Address is six bytes long with the first three bytes representing the vendor ID and the last three bytes being the NIC ID.  All six bytes are provided and are in hexadecimal format.  The MAC Address is also sometimes referred to as the Physical Address.

*MAC Address*

* An Internet Protocol Address (IPv4) address which you assign or gets assigned dynamically.  Note that each of the four values of the IPv4 address are separated by a dot and that the values can range from 0 to 255.  The IP address must be unique for each device on the network.

*IPv4 Address*

Realizing your mistake you return your printer to the store, and buy one with a NIC card. For simplification purposes let's assume that the NIC card has a default IPv4 address that can be accessed by your computers. You connect your Ethernet cable from your switch or hub into the printer's NIC RJ-45 port, turn on the printer, and amazingly now your computers can see the printer and each can print to it! Please note that there's a few more steps that you'd need to do to get everything working, but you get the idea.
