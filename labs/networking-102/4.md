## Step 4: What's the TCP/IP Suite ?

### TCP/IP Suite  

Another prevalent network communication model that should be mentioned is the TCP/IP Suite which is sometimes referred to as TCP/IP Stack or IP Stack. This model simplifies the communication model by uniting a few of the layers from the 7 layer OSI model to form a 4 layer model.  The TCP/IP Suite was released around the same time as the OSI model, and each has there own supporters and detractors.  The TCP/IP Stack is sometimes presented as a 5 layer model because the layer 1 and layer 2 are split rather than combined into one layer, but we'll stick with the 4 layer model here.

In the table below the functionality of each layer is described.  Essentially the functionality of the OSI layers 5,6 and 7 are combined into layer 4 of the TCP/IP Stack.  Layer 3 maps to layer 4 of the OSI model and layer 2 maps to layer 3 of the OSI model.  Finally, the OSI model layers 1 and 2 are combined into one layer called Network Access.

### Stuff to Think About
1. How is a Physical Topology different than a Logical one?

2. On what layer does data enter and leave a device?

3. What is encapsulation and de-encapsulation?

4. What are the layers of the OSI Model?

5. What is the purpose of the OSI Model and TCP/IP Stack?
