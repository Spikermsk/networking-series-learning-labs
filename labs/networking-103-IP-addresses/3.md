## Step 3: IP Classes and Private IPs

### IP Classes and Private IPs

Before you start using of binary numbers, there are a few more things you should know. They have five classes. Each class has a range of IP addresses. Classes A, B, and C are available for public use, while Class D is used specifically for multicast addresses. Class E is reserved for research and development, so is not available for public use.

*IP Classes*

Classes A, B, and C each have a range of IP addresses reserved for internal use, which means that they cannot be used on the public Internet. This internal use designation is known as *Private IP addresses*. It turns out that private IP addresses are quite useful because they are used in nearly all businesses and homes. There are several reasons for using them.

### Why are Private IP Addresses Needed?
1. Public IP addresses are not free; you/your company pays for each one. So using private IP addresses saves money.
2. Public IPv4 addresses are running out! There are 4,294,967,296 IPv4 addresses in total. Of those, there are only 3,706,452,992 public addresses. That may sound like a lot, but remember that there are over 7 billion people on the planet. In industrialized countries, each person typically uses several network devices, each with its IP address.
3. Private IP addresses offer a level of security. If your laptop has a private IP address, it's harder to trace its location because that IP does not get out to the Internet. Also, there are ways of obfuscating your IP to reduce the chance of being found.

### Private to Public IPs
Your laptop most likely has a private IP address, but it's able to access the Internet where only public IP addresses are allowed. How does that work? Your network uses Network Address Translation <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Computer_Science/NAT_and_PAT.asp">(NAT)</a> and Port Address Translation <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Computer_Science/NAT_and_PAT.asp">(PAT)</a>. When your data is about to leave your home or work, the router maps your laptop's private IP to a public IP address. When the data returns to that router, it looks up your private IP address and sends the data back to your laptop.
