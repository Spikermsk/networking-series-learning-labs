### How do Network Devices Find Each Other? Hint: The Answer is not Love!  

Step 1 showed a student computer sending data to an instructor computer. Here, let's discuss how sending data works. Suppose that you are the student and try to send a message to your instructor. How does the network send that message?

*Simple Local Area Network (LAN)*

First, your computer needs to know the IP address of the Instructor's computer. Let's assume the IPv4 address of the instructor's computer is 171.16.16.1 and the address of your computer 172.16.254.1. Here are the processes the network completes to deliver the data.

1. **Process One**: The switch receives your request and looks in its [ARP cache](http://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/5023/what-is-the-main-purposes-of-arp-cache-in-the-switch) to see if it knows the MAC address for IP 171.16.16.1. If it knows the MAC address, along with other information, it sends your data to that computer. Success! If the switch does not have the MAC address in its cache, then it goes to process two.
2. **Process Two**: The switch uses a protocol called [Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol) to [broadcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting_%28networking%29) an *ARP request* that asks all of the network devices "Who is IP address 171.16.16.1 ?". If one of the devices has that IP address, it sends an *ARP response* saying "That is me. Here is my MAC address". The switch then sends the data to that device. Success! However, what if no computers connected to the switch have that IP address? Then we move on to process three.
3. **Process Three** The switch sends the data to the router. The router looks in its routing table and determines to which switch it should route the data. In this case, it sends the data to the Instructor Switch. The Instructor Switch repeats *Process One* and possibly *Process Two*, finds the computer and sends the data to it. Success!

Step 2 talked about an office network connected by a switch or a hub to a printer. That network is quite simple and does not have a router. However, in this discussion, we have introduced two devices: a hub and a switch. Let's look at how the hub or switch operates when data is being sent from one network device to another - in this case from a computer to a printer. For convenience, we have included that figure below.

*Office Network*

First, your computer needs to know the IP address of the printer. Because there is no router in this network, the IPv4 addresses for all devices must be on the same [network segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_segment#Ethernet) so that they can find each other. Without going into too much detail 'being on the same segment' means that an IPv4 address can be found without the need of routing to another network segment. So, in our example, let's assume that the IPv4 address of the printer is 172.16.254.5 and your computer's IPv4 address is 172.16.254.1. You attempt to send data to the printer. With a switch, there are two processes.

1. **Process One**: The switch receives your request and looks in its ARP cache to see if it knows the MAC address for 171.16.16.1. If it knows the MAC address along with other information, it sends your data to that computer. Success! If the switch does not have the MAC address in its table, then it goes to Process two. Note that if you had just a hub, that device does not contain an ARP cache so it would start at step two. 
2. **Process Two**: The switch sends an ARP Request to broadcast a message to all devices connected to it saying "Who has IP address 171.16.16.5 ?". If a device, in this case, the printer, is connected to the hub or switch and has that IP address, it sends an ARP Response saying "That is me.  Here is my MAC address." The hub or switch then sends the data to that device. Success!  

A hub is not as sophisticated as a switch. It sends all data that it receives to all devices that are connected to it. It is also called a repeater because it repeats what it is told. As a result, with a hub, there is just one process.

1. **Process**: The hub receives your data and sends it to all of the devices that are connected to it. If one of the devices has the matching IP address, it will respond. Success!

To clarify, hubs are much less efficient than switches because they do not have an ARP cache and cannot use ARP. Hubs always broadcast data to all ports, which can saturate the network, consume bandwidth, and make computers reject data. Also, many switches have a feature called [microsegmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch#Microsegmentation) that provides the same bandwidth to all connected devices. In contrast, with hubs, all connected devices must share a limited amount of bandwidth. With microsegmentation, since bandwidth is not shared, network traffic flows smoothly without [collisions](http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/collision). Finally, switches typically can be heavily configured while hubs offer little or no configuration.

### Ideas to Consider
1. If a switch is more efficient than a hub, why would you buy a hub?

2. Now that you understand ARP, look up [RARP](http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/Reverse-Address-Resolution-Protocol) and determine when that protocol might be used.

**Next Step:**  What are switches, routers, and interfaces? How are they configured?
