**`image_install()`**

This function, collects the name of the kickstart and system image provided from the previous function to validate whether the current image on the device matches the desired image. If not, it uses the `tftp_server` information from the previous function, to download the correct image.
   
```

**`copy_config()`**

The `copy_config` function will use the protocol defined by the user (HTTP/TFTP) to download the device specific configuration that was generated in step 1. It uses the `config_protocol` to make a determination on the desired protocol to use. Depending on whether that was set to TFTP or HTTP, it uses the information provided by either the `tftp_server` or `http_server` to download the configuration file defined in `config_file`
   
```
Transfering config file over HTTP...
Data collected from HTTP request
Config data copied successfully to bootflash
INFO: Ready to execute terminal dont-ask ;copy bootflash:/9YARXTR3TWL.cfg scheduled-config
```
   

> Note: The copy `scheduled-config` command is used exclusively with POAP. It schedules the configuration that the switch will use on next reload and continue with the POAP process.

```
Waiting for box online to replay poap config
2017 Jul 28 15:14:48 switch %$ VDC-1 %$ %ASCII-CFG-2-CONFIG_REPLAY_STATUS: Bootstrap Replay Done.
```

At this point, the POAP process is complete and the switch will reboot into the desired configuration state.

While we only covered three of the main Python functions in `poap_script.py`, there are many other helper functions within the script that perform logging, cleanup, signal/interrupt handling, and a number of other functions.
