## Step 2: Binary Numbers

### Why do I Need to Know About Binary Numbers?
Binary numbers are fundamental to network subnetting and subnet masks, so they are important to learn.

### What are Binary Numbers?
When you viewed the IP addresses in step 1, you noticed that each octet included 8 bits of 1's and 0's. These 1's and 0's are called binary numbers. Each binary value can only have a value of 1 or 0.

Binary values are called base two numbers. Counting from right to left, you increment the exponent value of the base two, starting from zero.

*Base Two Decimal Values*

Notice how the exponent and therefore the decimal value increase from right to left. Also notice that after the right-most bit, where the value is 1, the all following values increase by a multiple of 2. If you add all of the values, you'll notice that the maximum value is 255. This maximum means that the value of each byte in a valid IP address may not exceed 255.


### How do I use Binary Numbers?
Now, look at a few simple examples of how to convert decimal to binary values. The process is to look at the decimal value and then determine which binary values need to be added together to equal the decimal value. You'll then express this value in binary format.

In the following table, cover the bottom two rows and see if you can determine which base two values to add together to equal the decimal value. Then, try to write the value in binary format.

Now, revisit the IP addresses previously specified in Step 1. you should see how the binary values match up to the decimal values.
