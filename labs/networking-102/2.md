## Step 2: Network Wiring and Cables

### How are network devices wired?
Shortly we'll discuss some of the various classifications of network cables, their capacity and more; however, let's first start with what's inside the cables which is wires. These wires are typically twisted together in pairs, which believe it or not, reduces interference between the wires. Wires that are twisted together with no additional shield are called unshielded.  There are also wires which have a shield that covers each twisted pair of wires and/or a shield that covers all of the wires in order to further reduce the possibility of interference. Cables containing wires with the additional shield are aptly named shielded.

### What are the different network cables categories?

Network devices are connected via network cables. However, the throughput, allowed distance and other characteristics of these cables will vary depending upon its rating.

*Ethernet Cable Categories*

The table above lists the most commonly used network cable categories. It should be clear that the network engineer cannot just run cables to any length that he'd like.  Due to resistance in the wires when the maximum length is reached the signal begins to degrade and data is lost.  As a result hardware devices called repeaters are sometimes needed to connect cables to repeat/strengthen the signal that is being sent.

### What are straight and crossover network cables?
To determine if you have a straight or crossover network cable you can typically just read the description written on the cable. However, a faster and more accurate way would be to take both ends of the cable in your hands and put the RJ45 male ends side-by-side. If the colored wires are in the same order on both RJ45's then you have a straight cable.  If the colored wires are in a different order, you have a crossover cable.

*Crossover Ethernet Cable*

### Using straight and crossover cables to connect these devices
While many network devices today allow the network engineer to connect them using a straight or crossover cable, it's still important for the engineer to use the right cable to prevent possible issues.  Whether the network engineer should use a straight or crossover cable to connect network devices depends upon the type of device being connected.  For example, if the engineer was connecting a switch to another switch he would use a crossover cable.  However, if he were connecting a switch to a router he would use a straight cable.

*Devices and Cables*

From the table above one might see that there are certain patterns.
  * Use a crossover cable to connect any device that connects to the same device type.  For example, use a crossover cable to connect a router to another router, a switch to another switch or a workstation to another workstation.  There are two exceptions to this rule: a hub connected to a switch requires a crossover cable, and if a router was to be connected to a workstation, which is not common, use a crossover cable.
  * Use a straight cable when connecting different devices.  For example, when connecting a switch to a router, a switch to a workstation, a hub to a router or a hub to a workstation, use a straight cable.


  ### Stuff to Think about
  1. If you were building your network and needed to connect a set of workstations to a switch which then connected to a router, what types and categories of network cables would you use to connect each device?
