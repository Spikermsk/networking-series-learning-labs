# Networking 102 Topologies and Models #

In this Learning Lab, you learn about various network topologies and cables along with the OSI and TCP/IP Suite network models.


## Objective ##

Completion Time: 15 minutes

* Learn about network topologies
* Understand network cable categories and types
* Study the networking OSI and TCP/IP models


## Prerequisites

* You have some knowledge about networks or have completed the lab Networking 101.
* Your focus in this lesson will be on wired networks which for your purposes is what you need to learn. Wireless networks have other network components not covered here.
* This topic is based on IPv4 protocol; otherwise known as Internet Protocol version 4.

## Additional Information

* Cisco provides online detailed tutorials on Networking at <a href="https://learningnetworkstore.cisco.com/">the Cisco Learning Network Store</a> and the <a href="https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/welcome"> the Cisco Learning Network</a>.

## Step 1. Physical and Logical Topologies

Every network has a physical and logical topology. The physical topology represents how the network is physically laid out. Here are some pictures of physical topologies.

*Network Physical Topologies*

1. Now, briefly examine each of the topologies.
  * **Bus**: There is one centralized cable or hardware device to which the host devices are connected using twisted pair wiring. Network data travel is bi-directional which means that data can collide.
  * **Full Mesh**: All devices are connected to each other for redundancy. This network is the most reliable. However, it is also the most expensive and difficult to set up due to extensive wiring. As an alternative, a partial mesh topology can be created.
  * **Star**: A central device connects to network and host devices using twisted pair wiring.
  * **Ring**: All devices are connected using a single cable and data is routed through each device traveling in a single direction until it reaches its intended target. The advantage of this topology is that there are no network collisions. However, it is susceptible to failure if a single node fails.
  * **Dual Ring**: Two rings enable data to be sent in opposite directions, creating redundancy. If one ring fails, the other continues to transmit data.

The logical topology represents how the physical topology operates. For example, the physical topology might be laid out in the form of a star topology, but its logical operation functions like a ring topology. This difference means that you cannot always tell how the network operates based on the physical topology.


### Something to Consider
1. What are some other network physical topologies?

2. Compare the Bus and Ring Topologies. What are the advantages/disadvantages of each?


**Next Step:**  Learn about network wiring and cables.
