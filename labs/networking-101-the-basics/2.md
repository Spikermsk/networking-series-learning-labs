## Step 2: Why do Some Devices Work on Networks While Others Do Not?

### What do Devices Need to Run on a Network?
Suppose you have a home office with four computers connected to a switch or a hub. You want to print data from those computers, so you buy a cheap printer. However, you cannot figure out how to connect your printer to your network.

It turns out that the printer cannot connect to the network because it does not have a Network Interface Card (NIC) card. Each of your computers has a NIC card and so should your printer.

*Network Interface Card (NIC)*

NIC cards vary in size. Some are smaller and look different from what is shown here.

This network card has the following features:
* It has a Registered Jack (RJ) 45 port (RJ45) that you can connect to a wired network using an Ethernet cable. There are many types of Ethernet cables, but they all have male connectors that can plug into an RJ-45 port.

* A unique ID that identifies the physical device called a Media Access Control (MAC) address. The MAC address is imprinted on the card and usually cannot be changed. It is six bytes long;  the first three bytes represent the vendor ID, and the last three bytes are the NIC ID. All six bytes are in hexadecimal format. The MAC Address is also sometimes referred to as the Physical Address.

*MAC Address*

* An Internet Protocol Address (IPv4) address. You can configure a static address, or the network card can get a dynamically-assigned address from a DHCP service on the network. AN IP address consists of four values, called octets, that range from 0 to 255 and are separated from each other by dots. An IP address must be unique on the network.

*IPv4 Address*

Realizing your mistake, you replace the printer with one that has a NIC card. The NIC card has a default IPv4 address that can be accessed by your computers. You connect the printer's RJ-45 port to the network hub using an Ethernet cable. Now your computers can see the printer and print to it! (For simplicity, this example omitted some details.)
