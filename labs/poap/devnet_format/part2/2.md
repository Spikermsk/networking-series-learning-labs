Navigate to the poap_app directory and start the application

``` shell
(python2) [root@localhost poap]#cd poap_app
(python2) [root@localhost poap_app]#
(python2) [root@localhost poap_app]# python poap_app.py

## Initiating the POAP Process

With all these pieces in place, we can now fire up our switches and observe POAP in action. 

### Booting up Brand New Switches

We will use a Python script to fire up a pod of brand new Nexus switches. To do this, issue the command `python virl_poap_simulation_setup.py`.

Ensure you're in the following directory:

```
/root/sbx_nxos/learning_labs/poap
```


```shell
(python2) [root@localhost poap]# python virl_poap_simulation_setup.py
Current VIRL Simulation Name: API-Test

Retrieving Console Connection Details: 
    Console to csr1000v-1 -> `telnet 10.10.20.160 17002`
    Console to nx-osv9000-4 -> `telnet 10.10.20.160 17008`
    Console to nx-osv9000-1 -> `telnet 10.10.20.160 17000`
    Console to nx-osv9000-3 -> `telnet 10.10.20.160 17006`
    Console to nx-osv9000-2 -> `telnet 10.10.20.160 17004`
(python2) [root@localhost poap]# telnet 10.10.20.160 17008

```

This will also give you the console information of the devices to connect to. 


In separate terminal sessions,open telnet sessions to each of the switches.  

You can do this using the Linux command for each device:

```
telnet 10.10.20.160 17008
```
