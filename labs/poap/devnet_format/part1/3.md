## Setting up the POAP Infrastructure 

In order to use POAP for bootstrapping Nexus switches, you'll need a few services deployed.  These include DHCP, TFTP, and a server on which to host configuration files and OS images (which is also a TFTP or HTTP server).

In the following sections we will look at each of these components, starting with the DHCP server, and you will perform the tasks required to install and setup each component in order to execute POAP on the four (4) Nexus switches in your pod.

Please note that, though the lab uses a single server to function as
the DHCP, TFTP, and configuration server, these can be different systems
and located anywhere in the network, as long as they are IP reachable
from the switch.  

### Preparing the DHCP server

The DHCP server is a critical cog in the POAP process. It assigns the IP address to the device and also instructs the switch about the TFTP server and name of the POAP script. To set up the DHCP server for this lab, we will be using an open source DHCP server called **ISC-DHCP**.  The dhcpd configuration file located at `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf` is what you'll be configuring.

You will configure the DHCP server by executing a pre-written Ansible playbook. 

After connecting to the DevNet sandbox lab environment, connect to your Linux devbox, and navigate to the `poap` directory where the playbooks are stored.

```
(python2) [root@localhost]# cd /root/sbx_nxos/learning_labs/poap
```

Now execute the Ansible playbook as follows:

```
(python2) [root@localhost poap]# ansible-playbook   devbox_dhcp_setup.yml 
```
> Please note that the settings used to generate the DHCP server configurations are configured within the playbook itself: `/root/sbx_nxos/learning_labs/poap/devbox_dhcp_setup.yml`. If you would like to use the playbook in your environment, be sure to update the file with details specific to you.

After the playbook executes, the file `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf` will be
updated and the DHCP process will be started on the devbox.

Open the file using `nano` or a text editor of your choosing. The relevant sections of the `dhcpd.conf` configuration related to the POAP DHCP process are shown here:

``` 
option tftp-server-address code 150 = ip-address;

subnet 172.16.30.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
  option routers 172.16.30.254;
  option tftp-server-address 10.10.20.20;
  option bootfile-name "poap_script.py";
}
host nx-osv9000-1 {
  hardware ethernet aa:aa:aa:aa:aa:aa;
  fixed-address 172.16.30.101;
}
host nx-osv9000-2 {
  hardware ethernet aa:aa:aa:aa:aa:ab;
  fixed-address 172.16.30.102;
}
host nx-osv9000-3 {
  hardware ethernet aa:aa:aa:aa:aa:ac;
  fixed-address 172.16.30.103;
}
host nx-osv9000-4 {
  hardware ethernet aa:aa:aa:aa:aa:ad;
  fixed-address 172.16.30.104;
}

```

You can see in the first line we are setting DHCP option 150, which provides IP addresses of TFTP servers, that we'll define in the actual DHCP scope in the scope definition.

> NOTE: Depending on the DHCP server software these configuration settings could vary.

In the lab DHCP server configuration above, we define `172.16.30.0/24` as the subnet from which IP addresses will be assigned to the Nexus devices. The configuration defines the IP address of the TFTP server, from where to download the POAP script and the name of script, to be downloaded. It also sets the default gateway to `172.16.30.254`.

The `host` section, for each device, defines the reservation binding an IP address to a given device MAC address.

The DHCP server service is now setup and we can move onto setting up the TFTP server process (also on the same server for us).
