## Step 4: What's the TCP/IP Suite?

### TCP/IP Suite  

Another prevalent network communication model that should be mentioned is the TCP/IP Suite which is sometimes known as TCP/IP Stack or IP Stack. This model simplifies the communication model by uniting a few layers of the 7-layer OSI model to form a 4-layer model. The TCP/IP Suite was released around the same time as the OSI model, and each has there supporters and detractors. The TCP/IP Stack is sometimes presented as a 5-layer model because layer 1 and 2 are split rather than combined into one layer. Here, you'll see the 4-layer model here.

In the following table, the functionality of each layer is described. Essentially the functionality of the OSI layers 5, 6, and 7 are combined into layer 4 of the TCP/IP Stack. Layer 3 maps to layer 4 of the OSI model, and layer 2 maps to layer 3 of the OSI model. Finally, the OSI model layers 1 and 2 are combined into one layer called Network Access.

### Something to Consider
1. How is a Physical Topology different than a Logical one?

2. On what layer does data enter and leave a device?

3. What are encapsulation and de-encapsulation?

4. What are the layers of the OSI Model?

5. What is the purpose of the OSI Model and TCP/IP Stack?

### Congratulations!  You have completed Networking 102 Topologies and Models!
