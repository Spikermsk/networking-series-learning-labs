# Step 3: How do networked devices find each other?

Part one of this lab showed a student computer that sends data to an instructor computer. This section explains the processes by which the data is sent.

#3 Example 1: Switch and router

*Simple Local Area Network (LAN)*

First, the student computer needs to know the IP address of the instructor's computer. In this example, the IPv4 address of the instructor's computer is 171.16.16.1 and the address of the student computer 172.16.254.1. Here are the processes the network completes to deliver the data.

1. **Process One: MAC address**: The switch receives the send request and looks in its [ARP cache](http://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/5023/what-is-the-main-purposes-of-arp-cache-in-the-switch) for the MAC address for IP 171.16.16.1. If it knows the MAC address, it sends the data to that computer. If the switch does not have the MAC address in its cache, then it goes to the next process.
2. **Process Two: Address Resolution**: The switch uses a protocol called [Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol) to [broadcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting_%28networking%29) an *ARP request* looks for IP address 171.16.16.1 on all network devices. If one of the devices has that IP address, the device sends an *ARP response* that includes the MAC address. The switch then sends the data to that device. If the ARP request does not return an IP address, the switch goes to the next process.
3. **Process Three: Routing table** The switch sends the data to the router. The router looks in its routing table and determines the appropriate switch to which it should route the data. In this example, the router sends the data to the Instructor Switch. The Instructor Switch repeats *Process One* and, if necessary, *Process Two*, and on identifying the device, sends the data to it.

## Example 2: Switch or hub without a router

Part 2 of this lab provided an example of an office network consisting of four computers and a printer connected by a switch or a hub. That network is quite simple and does not have a router. The following diagram shows how a hub or switch operates when data is being sent from one network device to another, as in this case from a computer to a printer.

*Office Network*

First, your computer needs to know the IP address of the printer. Because there is no router in this network, the IPv4 addresses for all devices must be on the same [network segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_segment# Ethernet) so that they can find each other. Without going into too much detail 'being on the same segment' means that an IPv4 address can be found without the need of routing to another network segment. So, in this example, assume that the IPv4 address of the printer is 172.16.254.5 and your computer's IPv4 address is 172.16.254.1. You attempt to send data to the printer. With a switch, there are two processes.

1. **Process One**: The switch receives your request and looks in its ARP cache to see if it knows the MAC address for 171.16.16.1. If it knows the MAC address along with other information, it sends your data to that computer. Success! If the switch does not have the MAC address in its table, then it goes to Process two. Note that if you had a hub, that device does not contain an ARP cache so it would start at step two.
2. **Process Two**: The switch sends an ARP Request to broadcast a message to all devices connected to it saying "Who has IP address 171.16.16.5?". If a device, in this case, the printer, is connected to the hub or switch and has that IP address, it sends an ARP Response saying "That is meHere is my MAC address." The hub or switch then sends the data to that device. Success!  

A hub is not as sophisticated as a switch. It sends all data that it receives to all devices that are connected to it. It is also called a repeater because it repeats what it is told. Therefore, with a hub, there is one process.

1. **Process**: The hub receives your data and sends it to all of the devices that are connected to it. If one of the devices has the matching IP address, it will respond. Success!

To clarify, hubs are much less efficient than switches because they do not have an ARP cache and cannot use ARP. Hubs always broadcast data to all ports, which can saturate the network, consume bandwidth, and make computers reject data. Also, many switches have a feature called [microsegmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch# Microsegmentation) that provides the same bandwidth to all connected devices. In contrast, with hubs, all connected devices must share a limited amount of bandwidth. With microsegmentation, because bandwidth is not shared, network traffic flows smoothly without [collisions](http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/collision). Finally, switches typically can be heavily configured while hubs offer little or no configuration.

## Ideas to consider
1. If a switch is more efficient than a hub, why would you buy a hub?

2. Now that you understand ARP, look up [RARP](http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/Reverse-Address-Resolution-Protocol) and determine when that protocol might be used.

**Next Step:**  What are switches, routers, and interfaces? How are they configured?
