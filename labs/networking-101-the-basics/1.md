# Networking 101 Basics and Software-Defined Networks

In this Learning Lab, you learn the basics of network devices, interfaces, software-defined networks (SDN), and REST APIs.


## Objective

Completion Time: 20 minutes

* Understand networking basics.
* Learn about routers and switches.
* Learn about SDN and REST.


## Prerequisites

This lesson:
* This lesson is for learners who want an introduction to networking and SDN.
* The examples focus on IPv4 wired networks. Wireless networks and IPv6 are not covered.
* This lesson covers networking at a very high-level. For more detailed information, additional lessons will be provided.

## Additional Information

* Cisco provides online detailed networking tutorials at <a href="https://learningnetworkstore.cisco.com/">the Cisco Learning Network Store</a> and the <a href="https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/welcome"> the Cisco Learning Network</a>. You can also watch videos about networks on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tln2dwj4WyA&list=PLOs8frNRg7sCWxsuAd2zujEQ-Kwy1Bm04">You Tube</a> or read <a href="http://www.ciscopress.com/">Cisco Press books on networking</a>


## Step 1. What is a Network?

A network consists of host devices such as computers, mobile devices, and printers connected by networking devices such as switches and routers so that they all can communicate with one another and share data.

*Simple Local Area Network (LAN)*

1. In the image shown, for the student computer to send data to the instructor computer, data would travel through the switch to the router (FastEthernet Interface 1/0), on to the next switch (FastEthernet Interface 0/0), before finally reaching the instructor computer.

2. The following frequently asked questions will be answered as you move forward.
  * Why do some devices work on networks and others do not?
  * How do devices find each other?
  * What are switches, routers, and interfaces and how are they configured?
  * What do REST and SDN relate to this information?

**Next Step:**  Learn about what devices need to run on a network.
