## Step 3: Network Communication Model

### The OSI Reference Model

At this point, you should be familiar with the various network devices, how to connect them, and some common network topologies. To understand how data is processed through the network, you need to understand the communication model.

In the past, network engineers realized that there would be many networks in the world and that for them to communicate a network communication standard needed to be created. In 1984, an organization known as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) created a standard model which they called OSI. The Open System Interconnection (OSI) model is a tool used to describe how network data, typically known as packets, is transported through the network. A packet is a unit of data that is transported over the network. A packet can vary in size depending on the data being sent, protocols being used, along with other configurations set by the user and the network.

In the OSI model there are seven layers.

*The OSI Model*


One common mnemonic that helps in memorizing the order of the OSI Model layers starting from layer 7 is: **A**ll **P**eople **S**eem **T**o **N**eed **D**ata **P**rocessing. Here are a few more mnemonics:

Here is a detailed view of each network layer, its function, some corresponding protocols and associated hardware.

*OSI Model Detail*

From a high-level point of view, data flows from the network application which resides at layer 7 down to layer 1 of the computer which would be the NIC card. The data is then sent onto the network, and is routed by network devices until it reaches its destination which in this example would be another computer. At this point, the data enters the computer at layer 1 (NIC card) and flows back up to layer 7 to be read on the destination computer application. To be transported on the network data must enter/exit network devices at layer 1.

*Data Flow, Encapsulation and De-encapsulation*

Notice that when data is being prepared to be sent that headers are added at each layer which is called encapsulation. Once the data is placed onto the network for transport, it is received at layer 1 by network devices. Each header is removed, and the embedded data for that layer is read as it travels up the stack. Removing the headers is called de-encapsulation. When data is being sent each layer adds its data and headers as the data is traveling down the stack to layer 1 where it is then sent onto the network. When a layer adds its headers this change is called encapsulation.



### Something to Consider
1. On which layers do switches and routers operate?

2. If a network engineer discusses MAC address issues, to which OSI layer is she referring?

3. The TCP and UDP protocols operate on what OSI layer?

4. Which mnemonic will you use to remember the order of the OSI layers?

**Next Step:**  What is the TCP/IP Suite?
