## Step 5: How to do Subnetting

### Why should I care about Subnetting?
As previously mentioned besides saving IP addresses, subnetting also allows the network engineer to divvy up the network assigning groups of IPs to various departments as needed.

### Subnetting Simple Example
Let's say that I have a class C IP address of 207.21.54.0 /24.  Recall that /24 is CIDR notation, and means my subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 which as previously mentioned is the default class C subnet mask.  In the last octal of the subnet mask each bit in that last octal can be used for hosts IPs. As a result on this 207.21.54.0 /24 network there can be up to 2^8 or 256 hosts.  The reason is that all of the bits left in a last octal are left alone.

The first IP address 207.21.54.0 is the network address. The last IP address 207.21.54.255 is the broadcast address.  As a result there are 256 - 2= 254 host IP addresses available.  As a result the IPs left for host devices would be 207.21.54.1 to 207.21.54.254, so the last host IP is 207.21.54.254.

### Subnetting Real World Example
Imagine that you're a network engineer and on your C class network you have 8 departments of 20 people each and want to assign a subnet to each department.  As a result you know that you need 8 subnets and those subnets should allow for at least 20 IP addresses for hosts.  You have an IP address of 192.168.2.7 to start.  Starting with the Class C default mask, we know that in the last octal we have 8 bits available.  We should borrow 3 bits to create 8 subnets, 2^3=8 and the remaining 5 bits for the hosts, 2^5=32. As a result in CIDR notation we write the IP address as 192.168.2.7 /27.

For a detailed look let's check out subnet mask given in CIDR notation in binary format.  Recall that with IPv4 addresses that there are 32 bits.  Also recall that the default subnet mask for a Class C IP address is 24 bits (111111111.11111111.11111111.00000000) or 255.255.255.0.  As a result the first 24 bits are used for the network.  We have 8 bits left for host IP addresses.  Since we need to create 8 subnets we borrow 3 bits from the last octal.  As discussed earlier each bit is a binary and represents base 2. We borrow three bits since 2^3=8 which gives us 8 subnets.  The remaining 5 bits are for the hosts.  In effect I've created 2^3 = 8 subnets and each subnet holds 2^5=32 hosts.

*Class C subnetting*

In the first subnet 192.168.2.0 is the network address, and the last IP address 192.168.2.31 is the broadcast address.  The last host IP address for that subnet is therefore 192.168.2.30.   A few of the subnets and relevant IP addresses are listed below.

# CIDR Notation Revisited
Now that you've got your first taste of subnetting, let's take a look at the expanded version of a CIDR notation table for class C.  Notice the allocation for subnets and hosts specified for each row.  It should be clear that borrowing bits to create subnets reduces the amount of hosts available for each subnet.  On this table the amount of hosts shown already takes into account that network and broadcast addresses each require an IP address.

1.  In IP address 192.168.5.23 /29, how many bits are allocated for subnets and hosts?
2.  In IP address 192.168.5.23 /29, how many subnets and hosts are created?
3.  Does a CIDR mask of /31 or /32 make sense?  Why or why not?
4.  If you need to allocate the network on IP 202.8.21.12 to have at least 12 hosts per subnet, what would be the CIDR notation?
5.  In the last Class C subnetting example above with IP 192.168.2.7 /27 what are the network, broadcast and last Host IP address for subnets 3,4,5, 6 and 7?
6.  You need to allocate the network on IP 205.225.16.84 to have at least 60 hosts per subnet.  Write the CIDR notation.  Then write the network, broadcast and last Host IP address for each subnet.

### Answers
<ol>
<li>5 bits are allocated for subnets and 3 for hosts.
<li>subnets = 2^5=32 and hosts are 2^3=8 .  So there's 32 subnets each containing 8 host IP addresses.
<li>No because /31 allocates 1 bit for hosts which is only 2^1=2 hosts and both IPs would be used for the network and broadcast addresses.  /32 allocates 0 bits for hosts so it's useless.
<li>202.8.21.12 /28
<li>Subnet 3: NW=192.168.2.64, BC=192.168.2.95, LH=192.168.2.94.  Subnet 4: NW=192.168.2.96, BC=192.168.2.127, LH=192.168.2.126.  Subnet 5: NW=192.168.2.128, BC=192.168.2.159, LH=192.168.2.158.  Subnet 6: NW=192.168.2.160, BC=192.168.2.191, LH=192.168.2.190.  Subnet 7: NW=192.168.2.192, BC=192.168.2.223, LH=192.168.2.222.
<li>Allocate 4 subnets each containing 64 host IP addresses.  205.225.16.84 /26 . Subnet 1: NW=205.225.16.0, BC=205.225.16.63, LH=205.225.16.62.  Subnet 2: NW=205.225.16.64, BC=205.225.16.127, LH=205.225.16.126.  Subnet 3: NW=205.225.16.128, BC=205.225.16.191, LH=205.225.16.190.
