### How do Network Devices Find Each Other? Hint: The Answer is not Love!  

In Step 1 we talked about how a Student computer could send data to an Instructor computer. Now let's delve into how this 'sending data' process really works.  Let's assume that you're on the network mentioned in Step 1 and that you're a student. For convenience we've included that figure below.  You want to send a message to your instructor.  How does the network send that message?

*Simple Local Area Network (LAN)*

First, your computer needs to know the IP address of the Instructor's computer. Let's assume the IPv4 address of your instructor's computer is 171.16.16.1 and as a student your computer's IPv4 address is 172.16.254.1 . You attempt to send data to your instructor's computer.  There are three subsequent processes that could occur that may result in success.

1.  Process One
  * The switch receives your request and looks in its [ARP cache](http://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/5023/what-is-the-main-purposes-of-arp-cache-in-the-switch) to see if it knows the MAC address for IP 171.16.16.1.  If it does know the MAC address along with other information it sends your data to that computer.  Success!  If the switch does not have the MAC address in its cache, then it goes to process two.
2.  Process Two
  * The switch uses a protocol called [Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol) to [broadcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting_%28networking%29) a message to all devices connected to it saying "Who is IP address 171.16.16.1 ?".  This broadcast is known as an ARP Request.  If a device connected to the switch has that IP address it responds with a message saying "That's Me!  Here's my MAC address!".  This response is aptly called an ARP Response. The switch then sends the data to that device. Success!  But what if no computers connected to the switch have that IP address? Then we move on to process three.
3. Process Three
  * The switch sends the data to the router.  The router looks in its routing table and determines to which switch it should route the data.  In this case it sends the data to the Instructor Switch.  The Instructor Switch repeats Process One and possibly Process Two, finds the computer and the data is sent to that computer.  Success!

In Step 2, we talked about an office network connected by a switch or a hub to a printer. This Network is quite simple and does not have a router.  However, in this discussion we introduced two devices: a hub and a switch.  Let's take a look at how the hub or switch operate when data is being sent from one network device to another - in this case from a computer to a printer.  For convenience we've included that figure below.

*Office Network*

First, your computer needs to know the IP address of the Printer. Because there is no router in this network, the IPv4 addresses for all devices must be on the same [Network segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_segment#Ethernet) so that they can find each other. Without going into too much detail 'being on the same segment' means that an IPv4 address can be found without the need of routing to another network segment. So in our example let's assume that the IPv4 address of the Printer is 172.16.254.5 and your computer's IPv4 address is 172.16.254.1 . You attempt to send data to the Printer.  With a switch there are two subsequent processes that could occur that may result in success.

1.  Process One
  * The switch receives your request and looks in its ARP cache to see if it knows the MAC address for 171.16.16.1.  If it does know the MAC address along with other information it sends your data to that computer. Success! If the switch does not have the MAC address in its table, then it goes to Process two.  Note that if you had just a hub, that device does not contain an ARP cache so it would start at step two.  
2.  Process Two
  * The switch sends an ARP Request to broadcast a message to all devices connected to it saying "Who has IP address 171.16.16.5 ?".  If a device in this case the printer, is connected to the hub or switch and has that IP address, it responds with a message saying "That's Me!  Here's my MAC address!" which is the ARP Response. The hub or switch then sends the data to that device. Success!  

A hub is not nearly as sophisticated as a switch.  It simply sends all data that it receives to all devices that are connected to it.  It's also called a repeater because essentially it just repeats what it's told.  As a result with a hub there's just one process.

1. Process
  * The hub receives your data and sends it to all devices that are connected to it. If the device connected to it has the matching IP address included within the data, it will respond.  Success!

One thing you might have correctly inferred is that a hub is much less efficient than a switch because it doesn't have an ARP cache or even do an ARP.  It always broadcasts data to all ports which can clog the network since unneeded bandwidth is being used and computers have to reject the data.  In addition, many switches have a feature called [microsegmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch#Microsegmentation) which provides the same bandwidth for all devices connected to it while on a hub all devices would have to share that bandwidth.  With microsegmentation since bandwidth is not shared, network traffic flows smoothly without [collisions](http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/collision). Finally switches typically can be heavily configured while hubs offer little or no configuration.

### Stuff to Think about
1. If a switch is more efficient than a hub, why would you buy a hub?

2. Now that you understand ARP, lookup [RARP](http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/Reverse-Address-Resolution-Protocol) and determine when that protocol might be used.

**Next Step:**  What are switches, routers and interfaces, and how are they configured?
