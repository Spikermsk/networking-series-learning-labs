# Step 2: Network wiring and cables

## Types of wires

Shortly you'll examine some of the various classifications of network cables, their capacity and more. However, first start with what's inside the cables...wires. These wires are typically twisted together in pairs to reduce interference. Twisted-pair wiring that does not have a shield is called *unshielded*. Twisted-pair wiring that has a shield covering each twisted pair or all of the wires to further reduce the possibility of interference is aptly named *shielded*.

## Network cable categories

Network devices are connected by network cables. However, the throughput, allowed distance, and other characteristics of these cables vary, depending on the specific rating of the cable.

*Ethernet Cable Categories*

The following table lists the most commonly used categories of network cable.

| Cable rating | Frequency | Data  performance | Channel length limit | Max data speed | Length limit at max | Notes                                                                                                        |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cat 5e       | 100 MHz   | 100 MBS           | 100 m                | 1 GBPS         | 100 m               | Can handle 1G Ethernet                                                                                       |
| Cat 6        | 250 MHz   | 1 GBPS            | 100 m                | 10 GBPS        | 37 m                | Can handle 10G Ethernet for a length up to 55 meters depending on cabling quality and installation practices |
| Cat 6a       | 500 MHz   | 10 GBPS           | 100 m                | 10 GBPS        | 100 m               |                                                                                                              |

A network engineer cannot run cables to an unlimited length. Resistance in the wires causes the signal to degrade past the maximum length, which causes data loss. Hardware devices called *repeaters* are sometimes needed to connect cables to repeat and strengthen the signal that is being sent.

## Straight and crossover network cables?

A network cable usually have a description printed on them that indicates whether it is straight or crossover. You can also hold the RJ45 male ends of the cable side-by-side. If the colored wires are in the same order on both RJ45s, it is a straight cable. If the colored wires are in a different order, it is a crossover cable.

*Crossover Ethernet Cable*

## Using straight and crossover cables to connect these devices
While many network devices today enable the network engineer to connect them using either a straight or crossover cable, it's still important for the engineer to use the right cable to prevent possible issues. The cable type depends upon the type of device being connected. For example, an engineer may use a crossover cable to connect a switch to another switch, and a straight cable to connect a switch to a router.

|             | Hub       | Switch    | Router    | Workstation |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Hub         | Crossover | Crossover | Straight  | Straight    |
| Switch      | Crossover | Crossover | Straight  | Straight    |
| Router      | Straight  | Straight  | Crossover | Crossover   |
| Workstation | Straight  | Straight  | Crossover | Crossover   |

*Devices and cable combinations*

This table reveals certain patterns.

* Use a crossover cable to connect identical device types, except in the case of hub-switch and router-workstation connections. Router-workstation connections are uncommon.
* Use a straight cable to connect different device types.

## Something to Consider

If you were building your network and needed to connect a set of computers to a switch which then connected to a router, what types and categories of network cables would you use to connect each device?
