## Step 5: How to do Subnetting

### Why should I care about Subnetting?
Besides saving IP addresses, subnetting enables a network engineer to divide the network by assigning groups of IPs to various organizations.

### Subnetting Simple Example
Now, suppose you have a class C IP address of `207.21.54.0 /24`. Recall that `/24` is CIDR notation. This means that if a subnet mask is `255.255.255.0`, it is the default class C subnet mask. In the last octet of the subnet mask, each bit in that last octet can be used for hosts IPs. Therefore, on this `207.21.54.0 /24` network, there can be up to 2^8 or 256 hosts. The reason is that all of the bits left in the last octet are left alone.

*Class C default*

The first IP address `207.21.54.0` is the network address. The last IP address `207.21.54.255` is the broadcast address. Therefore, there are 256 - 2= 254 host IP addresses available. Therefore, the IPs left for host devices would be `207.21.54.1` to `207.21.54.254`, so the last host IP is `207.21.54.254`.

### Subnetting Real World Example
Suppose that you are a network engineer, and on your C class network you have 8 departments of 20 people each, and want to assign a subnet to each department. Therefore, you need 8 subnets, and those subnets should enable at least 20 IP addresses for hosts. You have an IP address of `192.168.2.7` to start. Starting with the Class C default mask, the last octet has 8 bits available. You should borrow 3 bits to create 8 subnets, 2^3=8 and the remaining 5 bits for the hosts, 2^5=32. Therefore, in CIDR notation, you write the IP address as `192.168.2.7 /27`.

For a detailed look, examine the subnet mask given in CIDR notation in binary format. Recall that IPv4 addresses have 32 bits, and the default subnet mask for a Class C IP address is 24 bits (`111111111.11111111.11111111.00000000`) or `255.255.255.0`. Therefore, the first 24 bits are used for the network. You have 8 bits left for host IP addresses. Because you need to create 8 subnets, you borrow 3 bits from the last octet. As mentioned earlier, each bit is a binary and represents base 2. You borrow three bits because 2^3=8 produces 8 subnets. The remaining 5 bits are for the hosts. In effect, you've created 2^3 = 8 subnets and each subnet holds 2^5=32 hosts.

*Class C subnetting*

In the first subnet, `192.168.2.0` is the network address, and the last IP address `192.168.2.31` is the broadcast address. The last host IP address for that subnet is therefore `192.168.2.30`. A few of the subnets and relevant IP addresses are listed here.

# CIDR Notation Revisited
Now that you've got your first taste of subnetting, consider the expanded version of a CIDR notation table for class C. Notice the allocation for subnets and hosts specified for each row. It should be clear that borrowing bits to create subnets reduces the number of hosts available for each subnet. On this table, the number of hosts shown already takes into account that network and broadcast addresses each require an IP address.

### Answers
<ol>
<li>5 bits are allocated for subnets and 3 for hosts.
<li>subnets = 2^5=32 and hosts are 2^3=8. So there are 32 subnets each containing 8 host IP addresses.
<li>No because /31 allocates 1 bit for hosts which is only 2^1=2 hosts and both IPs would be used for the network and broadcast addresses. /32 allocates 0 bits for hosts so it's useless.
<li>202.8.21.12 /28
<li>Subnet 3: `NW=192.168.2.64, BC=192.168.2.95, LH=192.168.2.94. Subnet 4: NW=192.168.2.96, BC=192.168.2.127, LH=192.168.2.126. Subnet 5: NW=192.168.2.128, BC=192.168.2.159, LH=192.168.2.158. Subnet 6: NW=192.168.2.160, BC=192.168.2.191, LH=192.168.2.190. Subnet 7: NW=192.168.2.192, BC=192.168.2.223, LH=192.168.2.222`.
<li>Allocate 4 subnets each containing 64 host IP addresses. `205.225.16.84 /26`. Subnet 1: `NW=205.225.16.0, BC=205.225.16.63, LH=205.225.16.62`. Subnet 2: `NW=205.225.16.64, BC=205.225.16.127, LH=205.225.16.126`. Subnet 3: `NW=205.225.16.128, BC=205.225.16.191, LH=205.225.16.190`.
